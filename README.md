# AerisLab: Aerospace & Engineering Research Integrated Simulator

**AerisLab** is a high-fidelity, Python-based physics engine designed for the simulation of 6-DOF rigid body dynamics subject to holonomic constraints. It is developed specifically for aerospace engineering applications—such as parachute-payload systems—where accurate modeling of stiff linkages, aerodynamics, and variable-mass systems is critical.

The software implements a hybrid solving architecture, offering both fixed-step semi-implicit integrators for rapid visualization and variable-step stiff integrators (Radau IIA) for precision scientific analysis.
